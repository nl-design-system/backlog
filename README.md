# NL Design System

This place is our platform for the NL Design System community to develop new patterns and components. You will find the community backlog in [the Issues list](https://github.com/nl-design-system/backlog/issues). The overview of current developments in the project boards. For example:

- [Design Tokens](https://github.com/nl-design-system/backlog/projects/4)
- [Infrastructure](https://github.com/nl-design-system/backlog/projects/2)
- [Components](https://github.com/nl-design-system/backlog/projects/1)

Issues should remain open as long as they remain relevant for the project. This way it is possible to assign maintainers for every feature. Bug reports and other implementation specific tasks are best opened and discussed in the repository where the code is maintained, for example in [nl-design-system/web-component-poc](https://github.com/nl-design-system/web-component-poc).
